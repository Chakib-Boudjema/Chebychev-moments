# Chebychev-moments
this repo is explaining how to calculate Chebchev moments (form describer) using python

## Explanation
These moments are functions based on the discrete orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials.
The advantage of these moments is that the implementation does not involve a numerical approximation and that they do not require not a transformation of coordinates.
